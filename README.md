# The Weather App

Backend server built with Express and node-fetch to fetch weather information (city, temp, windspeed, etc) from external API, and frontend build in JavaScript without any frameworks.

## Get Started
Install the dependencies:
```
npm i
```
Follow the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to register and get your own API key.

Create a '.env' file and replicate the '.env_sample' file but use your API key and replace the 'YOU_API_ID_HERE' -text with your own API.

Then start the development server
```
npm start
```

Happy hacking!
